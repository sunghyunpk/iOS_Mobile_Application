We made shrdlu that can conversation with poeple.

Part A
we made the view part of the App at mainstory board 

Part B
we add greetting world that when we send text 'hi' or 'hello' shrdlu will response the Hello too.
Also we added 5 different type of feeling that people can enter, so when poeple entered the words that we represent the 5 different feeling, 
than the shrdlu will represnet the sentence to us. 

Part C
Also I made the HistroyViewController so when poeple we sse it, they can see the history of thier conversation.

Brief Instruction 
We designed this app to help people from COVID19 
When user start the app, they can see the 4 different buttons and one text field. when user write certain contry 
that they want to search and the press the TYPE button.
they will move on to RecordTableViewController screen, This will present the name of country they just entered 
and shows the current number of COVID19 patients at that country. 
For the AUTO button, when user press this button, it automatically dectect the users current country and move user to the RecordTableViewController screen to prevent user's current country's number of patients. 
When user press the Precaution and What is COVID19 button, both of them user to the view screen 
where users can get the information about the COVID19. 

For this Final Project we used Xcode 11.3.1 and we used iPhone8 for testing our iOS App. 

Required Features
For the User interface 
we used text, buttons for input and we used text for output. We used tab bar controller and navigator controller
for using 3 separate views. Last, we used table view controller to present the data to user. 
Substantial use 
We used the Core Location to detect the user's current location.
